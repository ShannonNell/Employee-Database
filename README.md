## Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine then open the terminal and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Be sure to create your own .env file in the root directory with your mysql login credentials and include it in your .gitignore file.

Then login to your mysql and run `source db/db.sql` to set up the database and `source db/schema.sql` to define the tables. If you would like to use my mock entries, run `source db/seeds.sql. Use `quit` to exit out of mysql then in the terminal once again enter `npm start` to begin the application.
